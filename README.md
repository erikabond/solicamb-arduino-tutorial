SoliCamb is a student-led initiative from the University of Cambridge. In partnership with the Centre for Global Equality, we aim to develop a low cost, durable and easy to use sensing platform to measure soil carbon and moisture content. Soil health monitoring is essential for the wellbeing of the local ecosystem and, on a larger scale, indicative of global warming status. Through engaging citizen scientists in Cambridgeshire (UK) and overseas in Umzimvubu (South Africa), as well as providing access to analysed soil data, this initiative aims to empower and engage the public with global issues relating to environmental sustainability.
